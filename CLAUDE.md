# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a minimal Svelte project called "fuel-mechanical-svelte" that is currently in its initial setup phase. The repository contains only a settings.json file with model configuration.

## Current State

The codebase is essentially empty except for:
- `settings.json` - Contains Claude model configuration (claude-4-0-opus)

## Architecture Notes

This project appears to be intended as a Svelte application but lacks the standard project structure, dependencies, and build configuration typical of Svelte projects. When working with this codebase:

1. Standard Svelte project structure is expected to be added
2. Build tools and dependencies will need to be configured
3. Component architecture will follow Svelte conventions once established

## Development Setup

Currently no development commands are available. Standard Svelte development workflow will likely include:
- Installing dependencies with npm/yarn
- Development server for hot reloading
- Build processes for production
- Testing framework setup
